<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I obtained my M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, in 2019 and 2022. I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. 

My research interests include mobile and ubiquitous computing, smart healthcare, and IoT/AI security.

[SDE: Early Screening for Dry Eye Disease with Wireless Signals](https://programs.sigchi.org/ubicomp-iswc/2024/program/content/174703/)

**Meng Xue**, Yuyang Zeng, Shengkang Gu, Qian Zhang, Bowei Tian, and Changzheng Chen 
[**Demo**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3631438) [**Project**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Q0JYVicAAAAJ&citation_for_view=Q0JYVicAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC) 

- In this paper, we propose SDE, a contactless, convenient, and ubiquitous DED screening system based on RF signals. By constructing frame chirps variance, we extract fine-grained spontaneous blinking action from RF signals.

[ARTEMIS: Defending against Backdoor Attacks via Distribution Shift](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10702439)

**Meng Xue**, Zhixian Wang, Qian Zhang, Xueluan Gong, Zhihang Liu, and Yanjiao Chen 
[**Code**](https://github.com/xmyun/Artemis) 
- In this work, we propose a novel backdoor defense approach called ARTEMIS, which utilizes distribution shifts to eliminate the discrepancy between poisoned and benign samples in the feature space. Additionally, ARTEMIS learns from domain-invariant features after the shift.

[Echo: Reverberation-based Fast Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Intelligent Audio Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534599)

**Meng Xue**, Peng Kuang, Xueluan Gong, Qian ZHANG, and Yanjiao Chen
[**Presentaion**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Q0JYVicAAAAJ&citation_for_view=Q0JYVicAAAAJ:eQOLeE2rZwMC) [Demo](https://echodisplay.github.io/
)
- In this paper, we propose a physical adversarial attack that exploits reverberation, a natural indoor acoustic effect, to realize imperceptible, fast, and targeted black-box attacks. Moreover, we generate reverberation-alike perturbations that blend naturally with the original voice sample.

[Wet-Ra: Monitoring Diapers Wetness with Wireless Signals](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534599)

**Meng Xue**, Yanjiao Chen, Xueluan Gong, Jian Zhang, and Chunkai Fan
[**Presentaion**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=Q0JYVicAAAAJ&citation_for_view=Q0JYVicAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC) 
- Diaper wetness monitoring is essential in various situations (e.g., babies and patients) to guarantee hygiene and avoid embarrassment. In this paper, we introduce Wet-Ra, a contactless, ubiquitous, and user-friendly diaper wetness monitoring system based on RF signals.
