<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher with <a href='https://hkust.edu.hk/'>the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST)</a>, under the guidance of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XTlaQMkAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN'>Prof. Qian Zhang</a>. Prior to HKUST, I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science at <a href='https://www.whu.edu.cn/'>Wuhan University</a> in 2022, under the guidance of <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ax6CbMgAAAAJ'>Prof. Yanjiao Chen</a> and <a href='https://cs.whu.edu.cn/szdw/zrjs.htm'>Prof. Jian Zhang</a>. I obtained my master's degree from Wuhan University. I spent my senior year as a visiting student at <a href='https://usslab.org/'> USSLAb</a> of <a href='https://www.zju.edu.cn/'>Zhejiang University (ZJU)</a>. 

My research interests include mobile and ubiquitous computing, smart healthcare, and IoT/AI security.

[SDE: Early Screening for Dry Eye Disease with Wireless Signals](https://programs.sigchi.org/ubicomp-iswc/2024/program/content/174703/)

**Meng Xue**, Yuyang Zeng, Shengkang Gu, Qian Zhang, Bowei Tian, and Changzheng Chen 
- [**Demo**](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3631438) 

- In this paper, we propose SDE, a contactless, convenient, and ubiquitous DED screening system based on RF signals. By constructing frame chirps variance, we extract fine-grained spontaneous blinking action from RF signals.

[ARTEMIS: Defending against Backdoor Attacks via Distribution Shift](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10702439)

**Meng Xue**, Zhixian Wang, Qian Zhang, Xueluan Gong, Zhihang Liu, and Yanjiao Chen 
- [**Code**](https://github.com/xmyun/Artemis) 
- In this work, we propose a novel backdoor defense approach called ARTEMIS, which utilizes distribution shifts to eliminate the discrepancy between poisoned and benign samples in the feature space. Additionally, ARTEMIS learns from domain-invariant features after the shift.

[Echo: Reverberation-based Fast Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on Intelligent Audio Systems](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534599)

**Meng Xue**, Peng Kuang, Xueluan Gong, Qian ZHANG, and Yanjiao Chen
- [**Projects**](https://echodisplay.github.io/)
- In this paper, we propose a physical adversarial attack that exploits reverberation, a natural indoor acoustic effect, to realize imperceptible, fast, and targeted black-box attacks. Moreover, we generate reverberation-alike perturbations that blend naturally with the original voice sample.

[Wet-Ra: Monitoring Diapers Wetness with Wireless Signals](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3534599)

**Meng Xue**, Yanjiao Chen, Xueluan Gong, Jian Zhang, and Chunkai Fan
- [**Presentaion**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HmM2UIYrUI) 
- Diaper wetness monitoring is essential in various situations (e.g., babies and patients) to guarantee hygiene and avoid embarrassment. In this paper, we introduce Wet-Ra, a contactless, ubiquitous, and user-friendly diaper wetness monitoring system based on RF signals.

[ChestLive: Fortifying Voice-based Authentication with Chest Motion Biometric on Smart Devices](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3494962)

Yanjiao Chen, **Meng Xue**, Jian Zhang, Qianyun Guan, Zhiyuan Wang, Qian Zhang, and Wei Wang
- In this paper, we propose to leverage the distinctive chest motions during speaking to establish a secure multi-factor authentication system, named ChestLive. We use acoustic sensing to monitor chest motions with a built-in speaker and microphone on smartphones.
